The material to be tested, if solid or semi-solid, may be wrapped in a sheet of nitrogen free filter paper for convenience in transferring it into the flask. Add 10 g of powdered potassium sulphate, 0.5 g of powdered copper sulphate and 30 ml of nitrogen free sulphuric acid. Incline the flask at an angle of about 45o and gently heat the mixture, keeping the temperature below the boiling point of the mixture until frothing has ceased. Increase the heat until the acid boils and continue the heating for four hrs until the solution acquires a clear greenish colour. Allow the mixture to cool, add 150 ml of water, thoroughly mix the contents of the flask and cool again. Add cautiously, so as to cause the solution to flow down inside the flask to form a layer under the acid solution, 100 ml of a 30 % w/v solution of sodium hydroxide in water. Add a few pieces of granulated zinc, and connect the flask by means of kjeldahl connecting bulb with a condenser, the delivery tube from which dips beneath the surface of a mixture of 30 ml of 0.5 N HCl or 0.5 N H2S04 and 25 ml of water contained in an Erlenmeyer flask or a wide mouthed bottle of about 500 ml capacity. Mix the contents of the flask by gentle rotation, and distil until about two thirds of the contents of the flask have distilled over. Add about 3 drops of solution of methyl red to the contents of the receiving vessel and determine the excess of acid by titration with 0.5 N sodium hydroxide. Repeat the experiment with the same quantities of reagents and in the same manner, but omitting the substance under test. The difference between the two titrations represent the acid required to neutralize the ammonia. Each ml of 0.5 N hydrochloric acid or 0.5 N Sulphuric acid is equivalent to 0.007004 g of N.When the nitrogen content of the substance under test is known to be low,0.5 N hydrochloric or 0.5 N sulphuric acid may be replaced by 0.1N hydrochloric acid or 0.1 N sulphuric acid and 0.1 N sodium hydroxide should then be used in titrating the excess acid.
